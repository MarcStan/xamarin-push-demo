# Push Demo

This repository contains a minimal Xamarin application to demonstrate the necessary configuration/implementation to get push notifications working.

Follow the [Push notifications in xamarin](https://marcstan.net/blog/2019/05/11/Push-notifications-in-xamarin/) tutorial to set up the remaining infrastructure required (notification hub & app registrations).
